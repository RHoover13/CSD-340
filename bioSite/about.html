            Laura was born in January 1989 in West Columbia, SC.  Her parents have been lifelong sweethearts and married for more than 40 years.  Laura attended Pelion High School and graduated in 2007.  While here she was heavily involved in track and field and the marching band, in which she played the saxophone.  After graduation, she enrolled and attended the University of South Carolina- Upstate.  Laura graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.  She then began working with Lexington Medical Center where she has held a few different positions in different specialty areas.  Laura enjoys camping with her family and friends and fishing.  Although she attended a University of South Carolina school, Laura is a die-hard Clemson University fan.  

Laura’s favorite place to vacation is the beach, and she enjoys laying out and reading a good book.  Do not let this fool you though, she is a champion sandcastle builder.  This is not confirmed, but I hear that her sandcastles can withstand hurricane-force winds.  

Laura is very passionate and dedicated to her family and strives to spend the absolute most amount of time with them as possible.  Laura and her husband recently began undertaking the roles of head coach and team mom of their oldest daughter, Abbie’s, girls’ softball team.  Their youngest child, Rylie, is four years old and is beginning her first year in softball this season, which be an adventure of its own.  Abbie and Rylie keep Laura very busy, but she couldn’t be any happier with how her life is turning out.
